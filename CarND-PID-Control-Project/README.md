Effects of PID values:
##### Proportional (P)
The P value is "proportional" to the error. This value effects how quickly your current state reaches the desired state. If the P value is too high, your desired state will be reached quickly with high overshoot. If your P value is too low, your desired state will be reached slowly with lower overshoot. Just P control is not a good method, so it is always combine as PD or PID (rarely PI).

##### Integral (I)
The I value is how the vehicle takes past errors into account for the new error. Increasing I typically smoothens out the response. Having Integral control in your controller allows your system to minimize error. Without I, error will never be minimized to zero resulting in a control system that never reaches the desired state.

##### Derivative (D)
The D value in our controller determines how much influence the rate of change of error effects the response. Adding D to your controller allows you to predict what the next error will be. A high D value can result in jerky movements of a vehicle, while a low D value will result in high overshoot since the system is unable to predict what the next error will be. 

## PID Tuning
The tuning process was done manually using educational guesses. I first began with all PID values as 0. I first started with tuning P initializing it at 1, and slowly lowering it at increments of 0.1 until the response was as smooth as possible using just P without going crazy.

I then began to tune D. This parameter was set to 1 and slowly increased at about increments of 0.5-0.8 until I saw the response settle to the desired steering command nice and smoothly. 

Lastly, I added I gain to minimize error. I started with an I value of 1, which was way too high. I immediately lowered I to 0.01 and continued to lower it until finding a sweet spot of 0.0015 which resulting in really good control and low CTE.

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
